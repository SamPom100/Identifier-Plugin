# Sam's Identifier-Plugin
Identify a player with a right click of a special tool


## Usage

You must have the `identifier.immune` permission node to summon the tool. This also renders you immune from detection.

Summon the tool with `/identifier`

Once you have the tool, right click a player with it (within a set range) to reveal their name.
